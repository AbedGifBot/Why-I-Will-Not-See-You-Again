### Reasons: A Draft

- You use the cry laughing emoji in nonsensical places.
- You said, "I'm vegan, if it makes a difference," in a context that suggested that you were trying to score points.
- You kept asking me questions about "parents," and didn't take the hint when I kept answering them with "well, my mum..." and even though I don't feel like you did anything wrong and I hate it when people expect other people to be mindreaders and so I acknowledge that I'm being hypocritical right now, it's just like, come on man.
- I've never seen you speedrun anything.
- You think that the fact that you're tall matters.
- Two words: BATHROOM. CARPET.
- I hate your dad.
- You said that you were in an abusive relationship because I called you "Sparkles the Magic Monkey."
- You sent a "Hello?? You there??" type of message when I didn't respond literally immediately.
- You asked me, "What's BioShack?"
